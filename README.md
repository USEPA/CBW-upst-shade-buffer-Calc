# CBW-upst-shade-buffer-Calc

This project details the approach and provides the R code for averaging effective shade for various upstream distance and travel time buffers with the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) as an example. Estimates of effective shade from riparian buffers can be used for the development of regional stream temperature models built from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus High-Resolution (NHDPlusHR) flowline network. This project was designed as a post-processing step that utilizes the output of the dmap-Rshade (https://github.com/USEPA/dmap-RShade) and CBW-cont-stream-temp-QC (https://github.com/USEPA/CBW-cont-stream-temp-QC) programs to calculate average effective shade for different upstream distance and travel time riparian buffers associated with stream water temperature monitoring stations and/or prediction locations snapped to the NHDPlusHR flowline network.

The main branch of this repository includes a R Markdown file with script that was used to generate the final average shade buffer dataset for the CBW and only an example dataset (test_datasets.RData). The example dataset was provided to allow the user to more efficiently test the script without the need to download large input files. The original inputs files, which include the output generated by dmap-RShade for the CBW for the months of July, August, and September, the coordinates/shapefile associated with 50m-interval flowline shade points, and the results generated by this script can be found at [insert link to Zenodo data repository]. The original monitoring station information (input) shapefile is stored separately at [insert link to Zenodo data repository]. A R Markdown .html file is provided in the repository for easier viewership. 

The R script is organized into 3 main sections.
1) Setup. Includes the installation and loading of R libraries required to run the script. This section also includes code to download, import, and organize the NHDPlusHR database for the CBW, site and/or prediction information files, the output of RShade for July, August, and September, and the coordinates that accompany the shade points.
2) NHDPlus High Resolution Indexing. Includes script to index monitoring station/prediction points and shade points to the NHDPlusHR flowline network, generating nhdplusids and "frommeas" and "tomeas" reach estimates for each site and shade point. The index is then used to estimate downstream travel times similar to the pathlength metric for distance.
3) Upstream Effective Shade. Estimates distance and travel times (as "the fish swims") for all shade points upstream of individual site/prediction points. A function is created that will take the average of effective shade values for upstream shade points associated with various distance and travel time buffer thresholds (e.g., 1-10km and 1-1000hrs). The function can then be applied to all site/prediction points using parallel processing.
